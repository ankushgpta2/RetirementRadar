# RetirementRadar

### Utilizes a ML model for predicting current state of the market at a macro level and the general dynamics to predict future states. 

Takes into account your personal preferences for investment and other information, such as:

**(a) Current State**
* Current retirment funds
  * How much do you currently have in your 401k and/or IRA?
* Personal amount of contribution 
  * How much are you contributing yourself?
* Matching from Employer 
  * How much does your current employer provide in-terms of matching?

**(b) Future State**
* Risk level 
  * Would you prefer safer investments with steady long-term yield or relatively higher-risk but greater return?
* Preferred final retirement amount 
  * How much money do you require for retirement?
* Preferred age to retire 
  * What is the preferred age for when you would like to retire based on contributions and cash out your IRA/401k?

** NOTE: This has the option to assess risk level for you, if you choose to do so. It will take into account a variety of factors with information you provide, such as age, other personal/general financial attributes, likelihood for overall contribution to change (changing jobs), potential lapses in employment and ability to contribute.

** NOTE: Degrees of freedom for each of these of variables + interaction amongst them will depend on the overarching decision of IRA vs 401k contribution. It will take into consideration a combined approach as well.
